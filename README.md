# Chat
chat application for organisational communication (using socket programming)
The aim of our project was to design a hierarchical chat application to be used within organisations. We used a two-level of hierarchy: manager-employee.
-Global chat application that can communicate over various networks using Socket programming.
-Real time chat using emoticons with added time-constraints on personal chat.
-Manager can add special announcements for employees in the notice board.
-Maintains database of registered and newly added users.

other features: 
-Client server architecture
-Enabled port forwarding 
-use of dynamic host name for server to enable global access(communication on two different machines)

How to run the application:
1) download the client and server files in your system and open them using netbeans
2) run the server first (login_server.java) 
3) start the client (login_win.java)
4) login with valid credentials or register as a new user
5) Now multiple users can chat as manager or employee and can use other features such as special announcements, personal chat, emoticons and many more

NOTE: for initial setup and running it is recommended to run all the files on localhost.
